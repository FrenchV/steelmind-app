## Performance Optimizations

- **Memoized Calculations**: Expensive stats calculations are cached
- **Batch Processing**: Storage operations are batched for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of timers and subscriptions
- **Debounced Updates**: User input is debounced to prevent excessive updates
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Complete user flows (onboarding ‚Üí logging ‚Üí exercises)
- **Performance Tests**: Timer accuracy and memory usage
- **Storage Tests**: Data persistence and validation

## Offline Support

The app is designed to work completely offline:
- All user data is stored locally using AsyncStorage
- No network requests are required for core functionality
- Data validation ensures integrity even without server backup
- Pending operations are queued for when connectivity returns

## Accessibility

- Semantic component structure for screen readers
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Large touch targets for easy interaction
- Clear visual hierarchy and navigation

## Privacy & Data

- All data is stored locally on the user's device
