# Soccer Mindset Coach - Development Plan

## Project Overview

A focused mobile app to help soccer players manage performance anxiety through practical mental tools, pre-game routines, and progress tracking.

## Current Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**:
- Phase 1: Data & State Management (Foundation)
- Phase 2: Core Features (Mood tracking, exercises, pre-game routines)
- Phase 3: Progress Tracking (Visualization and insights)
- Phase 4: Offline & UX Essentials (Onboarding, notifications, offline support)
- Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Testing, performance, stability)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Data & State Management (Foundation)

**Objective**: Build reliable data storage and global state handling so all user data is saved, retrieved, and shared across the app.

#### Local Storage

* Build an AsyncStorage wrapper (`services/storage.ts`) to store and retrieve user data.
* Add validation to prevent corrupted data and handle errors gracefully.

#### Data Models

* Create TypeScript interfaces (`types/index.ts`) for:

  * **MoodEntry**: Logs mood ratings, notes, and optional game context.
  * **ExerciseSession**: Tracks exercise type, duration, and completion.
  * **RoutineSession**: Saves pre-game routine steps and progress.

#### Global State

* Implement React Context (`contexts/AppContext.tsx`) for managing app-wide state.
* Create custom hooks for interacting with the data:

  * `useMoodData.ts` â€“ add, edit, and fetch mood entries.
  * `useExercises.ts` â€“ start, stop, and record exercise sessions.
  * `useRoutine.ts` â€“ manage pre-game routines and their completion.

---

### Phase 2: Core Features âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Deliver the main functionality of the app â€“ mood tracking, exercises, and pre-game routines.

#### Mood Tracking

* Allow users to log daily mood ratings (1-5) with optional notes and context (practice/game).
* Display a history of past moods in a simple list with a basic trend chart.

#### Exercises

* Build a **Timer** component (`components/Timer.tsx`) for timed breathing/mindfulness activities.
* Create guided breathing and mindfulness exercises (`components/ExerciseGuide.tsx`) with instructions.
* Save each exercise session and display a history of completed sessions.

#### Pre-Game Routine

* Let users customize their routine (add, remove, or edit steps).
* Provide a guided, timed flow for completing the routine (`components/RoutineFlow.tsx`).
* Save and track routine completion data.

---

### Phase 3: Progress Tracking âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Give users insights into their mental progress over time.

#### Visualization

* Show mood trends over time (`components/MoodChart.tsx`).
* Display simple stats on exercise completion.
* Advanced progress insights with correlation analysis (`components/ProgressInsights.tsx`).
* Highlight the connection between routine completion and mood improvement.

---

### Phase 4: Offline & UX Essentials âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Ensure the app works anywhere and feels polished.

#### Offline Support

* âœ… All features (logging, exercises, routines) work without internet.
* âœ… Local data validation and integrity checks.
* âœ… Offline status indicators and user feedback.

#### Onboarding

* âœ… Complete onboarding flow with 5 informative steps.
* âœ… Introduces mood tracking, exercises, and pre-game routines.
* âœ… Motivational messaging and clear value proposition.

#### Notifications

* âœ… Local notifications to remind users to log moods daily.
* âœ… Pre-game reminders for routine completion.
* âœ… Notification settings and permission management.
* âœ… Platform-aware notification support (disabled on web).

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization âœ… **COMPLETED**

**Objective**: Make the app reliable, fast, and stable.

#### Testing

* âœ… Unit tests for storage, timers, and mood calculations.
* âœ… Integration tests for key flows (onboarding â†’ logging mood â†’ exercise â†’ routine).
* âœ… Performance tests for timer accuracy and memory usage.
* âœ… Storage tests for data persistence and validation.

#### Performance

* âœ… Optimize data loading and memory usage with memoization.
* âœ… Ensure timers clean up properly and the app runs smoothly on iOS and Android.
* âœ… Implement batch processing for storage operations.
* âœ… Add performance monitoring and memory leak prevention.
* âœ… Debounce user inputs and throttle expensive operations.

#### Stability

* âœ… Comprehensive error handling and recovery.
* âœ… Memory leak prevention with cleanup managers.
* âœ… Timer stability improvements.
* âœ… Data validation and integrity checks.
